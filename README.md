# LinkedinCourses_ML

This repository contains exercises I completed from multiple Linkedin Learning courses I tried.

The course paths are:
1) Become a Machine Learning Specialist (sections 1-4)
* I stopped in the middle since I found it no longer relevant for me.
2) Advance Your Skills in Deep Learning and Neural Networks
