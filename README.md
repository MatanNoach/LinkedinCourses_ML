# LinkedinCourses_ML

## This repository contains exercises I completed from multiple Linkedin Learning courses I tried regarding Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science.

The course paths are:
1) Become a Machine Learning Specialist (sections 1-4)
    * I stopped in the middle since I found it no longer relevant for me.
2) Advance Your Skills in Deep Learning and Neural Networks

### Maaping Directories to Courses:

* decision_trees -> Machine Learning and AI Foundations: Decision Trees with SPSS
* recommendation_system -> Building a Recommendation System with Python Machine Learning & AI
* working_with_keras -> Building Deep Learning Applications with Keras 2.0
* face_recognition - Deep Learning: Face Recognition
* image_recognition - Deep Learning: Image Recognition
* tensorflow_js - Learning TensorFlow with JavaScript
* nlp_essentials - NLP with Python for Machine Learning Essential Training
